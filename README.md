## Text Summarization using TF-IDF and Gensim TextRank & Web Scraping

In an era defined by information saturation, the demand for efficient text summarization has never been more pronounced. This project addresses this need by crafting an automated summarization system that seamlessly combines web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and sophisticated algorithms. The core objective is to distill crucial insights from web content through a meticulous pipeline, encompassing tokenization, TF-IDF analysis, and sentence scoring. Through the synergy of these techniques, the project aims to produce concise and relevant summaries that encapsulate the essence of the original text.
Beyond traditional approaches, the project explores the efficacy of Gensim's TextRank algorithm, providing an additional layer of insight into extractive summarization. By scrutinizing the outcomes of diverse summarization strategies, this project contributes to a nuanced understanding of the strengths and limitations inherent in different text summarization methodologies. The ensuing sections delve into the intricacies of the project's methodology, outlining the challenges encountered and the compelling outcomes achieved in the quest for an effective text summarization solution.
