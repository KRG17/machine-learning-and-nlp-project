## Text Summarization using TF-IDF and Gensim TextRank & Web Scraping

This project focuses on creating an automated text summarization system by integrating web scraping, natural language processing (NLP), and advanced algorithms. It employs techniques such as tokenization, TF-IDF analysis, and sentence scoring to distill key insights from web content. The project also explores Gensim's TextRank algorithm for extractive summarization. Through diverse summarization strategies, it aims to provide concise and relevant summaries, contributing to a nuanced understanding of different summarization methodologies. The methodology, challenges, and outcomes are discussed in detail.
